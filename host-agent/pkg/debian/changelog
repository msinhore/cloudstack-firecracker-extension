  * Make API truly RESTful; consolidate legacy RPC endpoints into resource routes
  * Add POST /v1/vms to create+start VMs; persist network config derived from Spec
  * Add per-VM actions: start/stop/reboot/status/delete under /v1/vms/{name}
  * Add POST /v1/vms/{name}/recover; accept optional Spec fallback for recovery
  * Keep /v1/network-config/{name} endpoints for recovery tooling (apply/get/delete)
  * Allow CLI/REST to replay Specs when no saved config exists; add CLI recover
  * Parse NICs (deviceId, mac, vlan) from CloudStack payload into Spec/network config
  * Separated orchestration layer into dedicated modules
  * Created dedicated modules for configuration, state, and utilities
  * Improved code organization with clear separation of concerns
  * Improved code quality and PEP8 compliance
  * Better error handling and validation
  * Enhanced documentation and code comments
  * Typer-based CLI interface
  * Pluggable storage backends (file, LVM, LVM-thin)
